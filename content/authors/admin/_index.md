I am an undergraduate student at Western Washington University studying computer science. My research experience has primarily been in computer vision, computing education, and bioinformatics; however I am also interested in the more theoretical aspects of computer science. I really enjoy seeing all the intersections of math and computer science. I currently work as a web developer and research assistant while most of my free time includes trail running, biking, and bread making. I am currently looking for graduate programs to start in fall 2021.
